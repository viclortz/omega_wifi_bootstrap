Secure Headless IoT Device WiFi Bootstrapping
=================================

IoT market growth is being driven by many factors, including a precipitous
drop in hardware costs for Internet-capable devices, near ubiquitous
coverage with low-cost wireless networks, and cloud computing for scalable
management and analytics.

However, there are significant challenges in the
area of secure enrollment and connection of headless devices to services
on the Internet.

The industry is moving forward to fill this gap, and many
solutions have been proposed and are being deployed. This project represents
one such approach. My purpose in releasing this code is to advocate for
solutions having similar characteristics, considering this example as a
kind of software pattern. 

Although the overall approach is generic, this particular project uses
the impressive Onion Omega (and Omega2) device. The Omega
has built-in WiFi and runs the OpenWRT Linux OS. It is a perfect example
of the amazingly powerful and inexpensive new generation of embedded IoT
platforms. The kickstarter price of an Omega2 was $5 or $9, depending on 
the version of the module.

Motivation
--------------------------------
Over the years, I have greatly appreciated the hard work of countless open
source authors who have done great work and shared the fruit of their labor
with the world. It is an inspiring and powerful approach with undeniable
impact. I hope others who study this project will gain insight and practical
benefit, ultimately improving the security and usability of the products they
in turn produce. We all share a common responsibility to solve these problems
together.
